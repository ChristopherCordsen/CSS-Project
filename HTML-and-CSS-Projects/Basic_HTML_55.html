			<h2>Whenever I'm alone with you
			You make me feel like I am home again
			Whenever I'm alone with you
			You make me feel like I am whole again
			Whenever I'm alone with you
			You make me feel like I am young again
			Whenever I'm alone with you
			You make me feel like I am fun again
			However far away
			I will always love you
			However long I stay
			I will always love you
			- Adele
